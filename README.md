# Predicting Bike Rentals

Bike-sharing company wants to know how many bikes it needs because if there are too few or too many it loses money. I help the company by predicting the number of rides on a given day.

### Overview

I code a neural network from scratch and train it on historical data. Finally I compare the predicted bike rentals against real data.

### Methods

* Neural network

### Tech

* Python
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Pandas

## How to use

To take a look at the results, just click on `bike-rentals.ipynb` and it should open automatically. To take a look at the model, go to the `NeuralNetwork.py`.`

Alternatively you can download the repository and see the report file `bike-rentals.html`.

## Dataset

I use the dataset from [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). It contains records from 2011-2012 collected by the bike-share company in Washington D.C.

#### Size

There are 731 records (each one for each day) and 16 features.
